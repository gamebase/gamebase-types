GameBase Types
-----------------

Using the code developed by Mozilla (and Little Worlds) for BrowserQuest as a base, GameBase is intended to be collection of reusable components for the creation of top-down HTML5 browser based games.

The types component is designed to provide common source for files which can be used on both the server, and client side.
